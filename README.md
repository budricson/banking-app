<h1 align="left">Welcome to my fictional bank web app!</h1>

This project was created as part of a tutorial on how to build a web app using JavaScript. It is a simple app that allows users to view the bank's data and make transactions. I enjoyed the process of building this project and it helped me improve my skills in web development. I hope that others who view my repository can learn from my experience and find this project useful.

<h2>Project Outcome </h2>
The app is laid out with a simple navigation bar and a main area where users can view the bank's data and make transactions. The app has different routes for viewing account details, making a deposit or withdrawal, and viewing transaction history. Users can input their transaction details in a form and submit it to make a deposit or withdrawal. The app uses React's state management to keep track of the user's account details and transactions. The app fetches the bank's data from an API, allowing it to display up-to-date information to users.<br>
